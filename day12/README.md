#Day twelve

The code has been adapted from DarrylG's answer on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60847450/path-finding-in-2d-map-with-python

It works, but is not precise enough, which makes it work for the example (input2) but takes too much time in the case of the input that needs to be treated for the answer (input)

The pathfinding has been done by hand, which is sh*t.
I'll come back to this one when i'll get the time, but i'm too tired to do it RN.
